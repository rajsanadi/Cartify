Cartify is a comprehensive Product Management System developed in September 2024, designed to manage products, categories, orders, and carts. The backend is built with ASP.NET Core Web API, featuring RESTful APIs, custom middleware, robust logging, and exception handling. JWT-based authentication secures API access, enforcing role-based control. The application includes advanced search capabilities, such as case-insensitive product searches, and a responsive frontend developed with ReactJS and Redux, with connectivity handled by the Fetch API. Extensive validations and error handling ensure system robustness and reliability.
